# leaflet-challenge

This repo includes one html, one css, and one javascript file. 

The html file is very basic, it only includes depencies and an ID to call for our map. 

The javascript file creates a leaflet map of earthquakes in the last week using an API call.
The map includes 4 different base layers, and 2 different overlay layers. 
You can toggle the earthquakes and tectonic plates.
The map also includes a legend that shows what depth corresponds to the color of each cirlce representing an earthquake. 

The css file makes the map take up the entire screen. It also gives colors and formatting to the legend included.
